# Stats_Modules_student
This repository contains data science modules in Jupyter Notebook format, designed to be integrated into Introductory Statistics courses as part of the curriculum at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC). Students are not expected to have programming experience. The jupyter notebook format provides a way to expose students to coding in an interactive way, while covering the core topics in an Introductory Statistics course. The jupyter notebooks follow the same format used CS/MATH 118 (Data Science for All), a foundation in Data Science course modeled after UC Berkeleyâ€™s Data 8 course.
